# Exploring Terrorism Victim Data in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

Welcome to the repository of the final project for the "Programming and Databases" course. This repository has been created to showcase a comprehensive analysis of terrorism victim data within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Below is an overview of the project, divided into three main phases: dataset cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling using machine learning approaches.

## Contents

### 1. Dataset Cleaning
In the first phase of the project, we dedicated ourselves to the thorough cleaning of the dataset. This process involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing variables, and addressing any anomalies. The goal was to ensure that the dataset was reliable and ready for subsequent analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the following phase, we conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis. Through visualizations and descriptive statistics, we aimed to understand the distribution of terrorism victims in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over time. We explored correlations between different variables and identified trends that could provide significant insights.

### 3. Machine Learning Modeling
The third part of the project focused on applying machine learning models to predict certain aspects related to terrorism victims. This phase allowed us to identify hidden patterns in the data and make predictions based on relevant factors identified during the EDA.

## Repository Structure
